              <div className="beyond-paragraph">I'm a Full Stack Web Developer (React | Express | Node | PSQL) looking to join a dynamic team where I can apply my skills to build impactful apps that drive business success and -hopefully!- improve people's lives. </div>
                
                
              <div className="beyond-paragraph"> Outside of coding, I enjoy road cycling, dancing to Cuban rhythms, and exploring diverse interests—mainly trying to understand the world we live in, from attempting to grasp quantum mechanics (spoiler: I don't) to studying the arguments on both sides of major political issues. My experiences range from <b>teaching Spanish to refugees</b> and managing a <b>top hotel in Haiti</b> to developing an app to help restaurant colleagues distribute tips more fairly.</div>

              <div className="beyond-paragraph">I’m a knowledge enthusiast with a diverse educational background that spans tourism, hotel management, applied linguistics, teaching Spanish as a second language, and web development. <b>I earned my Master’s Degree at 35</b>, more than a decade after completing my first higher education degree. <b>Guess what, when I turned 40 I decided to learn Web Development.</b></div>

              <div className="beyond-paragraph">As an adult, I’ve lived in <b>five countries:</b> Spain, Finland, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and now Canada. My career has taken me from managing hotels with as few as 70 rooms to those with up to 1,200 rooms, and from working in small companies with just 5 employees to large ones with 1,000.</div>

              <div className="beyond-paragraph">In my journey as a web developer, I started by creating an app to <b>support my dancing community</b>, where users can access videos of dance steps and learn their Spanish pronunciations. I then developed a straightforward app <b>to help my restaurant colleagues</b> fairly distribute their tips, where previously there was no standard.</div>

              <div className="beyond-paragraph">My latest project is a social media platform tailored for cycling and running enthusiasts. It enables users to discover and share maps and routes, join planned rides and runs, and create routes for the community.</div>

              <div className="beyond-paragraph">I always have a new project in mind and a book waiting to be read (though I might need to stop buying them faster than I can read). I also can’t resist <b>my weekly dose of New Scientist Magazine</b>, even if I struggle to grasp some of the more complex topics, like quantum mechanics. </div>
